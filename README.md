## DISCLAIMER

Note: This is now a legacy branch and is not supported in any form. This is provided solely so users can maintain old installations of the bootleg tools.

This is a barebones placeholder FGD. You can place the entities, but I have not setup all of the options and settings for them. Obviously, It's missing a lot.
I have not tested all of these! Not everything is guaranteed to work!!

## HOW TO INSTALL

Drop all FGD files and gameinfo.gi into game\hlvr
Note: This now includes the gameinfo.
